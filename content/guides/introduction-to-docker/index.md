Docker has revolutionized how developers build, share, and run applications. Instead of worrying about environment differences or complex setup procedures, Docker enables you to package your application with everything it needs to run - code, runtime, system tools, and libraries - and deploy it as a single, lightweight, portable container.

This guide walks you through Docker from the ground up. We'll start with fundamental concepts and gradually move to more advanced topics and best practices. By the end, you'll be able to confidently use Docker for your development workflows and understand how it fits into modern DevOps practices.

## What You'll Learn

- Core Docker concepts and architecture
- How to install Docker on various platforms
- Working with Docker images and containers
- Building custom Docker images with Dockerfiles
- Managing data with Docker volumes
- Understanding Docker networking
