As you become more proficient with Git, you'll encounter situations that require more advanced techniques. This section covers powerful Git features that can help you handle complex workflows and scenarios.

## Advanced Rebasing Techniques

### Interactive Rebase with Fixup

When you need to make changes to a previous commit, you can use the fixup option:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit --fixup commit-hash

# Then rebase to incorporate the fixup
git rebase -i --autosquash HEAD~5
```

The `--autosquash` flag automatically moves fixup commits next to the commits they're fixing and marks them as `fixup`.

### Rebase onto a Different Base

Sometimes you need to move a branch from one base to another:

```bash
git rebase --onto new-base old-base feature-branch
```

This rebases the commits between `old-base` and `feature-branch` onto `new-base`.

Example: Moving a branch from one feature branch to another:

```bash
# Before:
#  main
#    |
#    A---B---C feature-1
#         \
#          D---E---F feature-2

git rebase --onto main feature-1 feature-2

# After:
#  main
#    |
#    A---D'---E'---F' feature-2
#    |
#    B---C feature-1
```

### Preserving Merges During Rebase

By default, rebasing flattens merge commits. To preserve the merge structure:

```bash
git rebase -i --rebase-merges HEAD~10
```

This is useful when you want to keep the context of merges in your history.

## Stashing Advanced Techniques

### Stashing Specific Files

To stash only specific files:

```bash
git stash push -m "Work on login component" src/components/Login.js
```

### Creating a Branch from a Stash

If you want to apply a stash to a new branch:

```bash
git stash branch new-branch stash@{1}
```

This creates a new branch starting from the commit where the stash was created, applies the stash, and drops it if successful.

### Managing Multiple Stashes

When you have multiple stashes, you can:

List all stashes with details:

```bash
git stash list --stat
```

Show the contents of a specific stash:

```bash
git stash show -p stash@{2}
```

Apply a specific stash without removing it:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{2}
```

Remove a specific stash:

```bash
git stash drop stash@{2}
```

### Stashing Untracked Files

By default, `git stash` only saves tracked files. To include untracked files:

```bash
git stash -u
```

To include ignored files as well:

```bash
git stash -a
```

## Submodules and Subtrees

### Working with Submodules

Submodules allow you to include other Git repositories within your repository:

Adding a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/username/library.git lib/library
```

Initializing submodules after cloning:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Or clone with submodules in one step:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/username/project.git
```

Updating all submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

### Git Subtrees

Subtrees are an alternative to submodules that merge external repositories into a subdirectory:

Adding a subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=lib/library https://github.com/username/library.git main --squash
```

Updating a subtree:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=lib/library https://github.com/username/library.git main --squash
```

Contributing back to the original repository:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix=lib/library https://github.com/username/library.git contribution-branch
```

### Submodules vs Subtrees

| Feature             | Submodules               | Subtrees           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Storage             | References only          | Full copy of code  |
| Learning curve      | Steeper                  | Gentler            |
| Dependency tracking | Explicit version         | Can be less clear  |
| Updates             | Manual                   | Can be easier      |
| External changes    | Need explicit permission | Can modify locally |
| Best for            | Third-party libraries    | Project splitting  |

## Rewriting History

### Filtering Repository History

For extensive history rewriting, use git-filter-repo (the modern replacement for git-filter-branch):

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo
pip install git-filter-repo

# Remove a file from all of history
git filter-repo --path path/to/large-file.bin --invert-paths
```

This is useful for:

- Removing large files
- Removing sensitive information
- Extracting a subfolder into its own repository

### Splitting a Repository

To extract a subdirectory into a new repository:

```bash
git filter-repo --subdirectory-filter path/to/subdirectory
```

This rewrites history as if the subdirectory had been the root of the repository all along.

### Combining Repositories

To merge the history of multiple repositories:

```bash
# Add the other repository as a remote
git remote add other-repo https://github.com/username/other-repo.git
git fetch other-repo

# Merge with the allow-unrelated-histories flag
git merge other-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve any conflicts
git commit
```

## Advanced Merge Strategies

### Octopus Merge

When merging more than two branches at once:

```bash
git merge branch1 branch2 branch3
```

This creates a single merge commit with multiple parents. It only works if there are no conflicts.

### Merge with Strategy Options

Git offers several merge strategies with customizable options:

Recursive strategy with patience algorithm (better handling of complex changes):

```bash
git merge feature-branch -s recursive -X patience
```

Ignore whitespace changes during merge:

```bash
git merge feature-branch -X ignore-space-change
```

Favor one side in conflicts:

```bash
git merge feature-branch -X ours  # Keep our version in conflicts
```

Or:

```bash
git merge feature-branch -X theirs  # Use their version in conflicts
```

## Refs and Refspecs

### Understanding Git References

Git uses references (refs) to point to commits:

- `HEAD`: The current commit you're working on
- `refs/heads/main`: The main branch
- `refs/tags/v1.0.0`: A tag named v1.0.0
- `refs/remotes/origin/main`: The main branch on the origin remote

You can use symbolic references to refer to commits:

```bash
HEAD~3  # Three commits before HEAD
main^2  # The second parent of the main branch tip (for merge commits)
v1.0.0^{} # The commit object that the tag points to
```

### Using Refspecs for Remote Operations

Refspecs define the mapping between remote and local references:

```bash
git fetch origin +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```

This fetches all branches from origin and stores them as remote-tracking branches.

To fetch only specific branches:

```bash
git fetch origin main:refs/remotes/origin/main develop:refs/remotes/origin/develop
```

### Creating Custom Refspecs

You can set up custom refspecs in your git config:

```bash
[remote "origin"]
    url = https://github.com/username/repo.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
```

With this configuration, `git fetch` will also fetch all pull requests from GitHub.

## Git Hooks

### Creating Useful Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically on certain Git events. They're stored in the `.git/hooks` directory.

Pre-commit hook to prevent committing large files:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check for files larger than 5MB
large_files=$(find . -type f -size +5M -not -path "./.git/*")

if [ -n "$large_files" ]; then
  echo "Error: Attempting to commit large files:"
  echo "$large_files"
  echo "Please remove these files or add them to .gitignore"
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

Commit-msg hook to enforce commit message conventions:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/commit-msg

commit_msg_file=$1
commit_msg=$(cat "$commit_msg_file")

# Check if the message follows conventional commits format
if ! echo "$commit_msg" | grep -qE '^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .+'; then
  echo "Error: Commit message does not follow the conventional commits format."
  echo "Example: feat(auth): add login functionality"
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

### Sharing Hooks with Your Team

Git hooks aren't copied when a repository is cloned. To share hooks:

1. Store hooks in a directory in your repository:

   ```
   project/
   ├── .git/
   └── git-hooks/
       ├── pre-commit
       ├── commit-msg
       └── ...
   ```

2. Set up a script to install the hooks:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # setup-hooks.sh

   cp git-hooks/* .git/hooks/
   chmod +x .git/hooks/*
   ```

3. Document the process in your README

Alternatively, use a tool like Husky for npm projects to manage hooks in package.json.

## Working with Patches

### Creating and Applying Patches

Patches allow you to share changes without a common remote repository:

Creating a patch for the last commit:

```bash
git format-patch -1 HEAD
```

Creating patches for a range of commits:

```bash
git format-patch main..feature-branch
```

Applying a patch:

```bash
git apply path/to/0001-commit-message.patch
```

Applying and creating a commit:

```bash
git am path/to/0001-commit-message.patch
```

### Creating Patch Series

For a series of related changes:

```bash
git format-patch -o patches/ main..feature-branch --cover-letter
```

This creates a series of patch files with a cover letter that you can edit to explain the entire series.

## Git Attributes

### Customizing Git's Behavior with Attributes

Git attributes, defined in `.gitattributes`, control how Git handles different file types:

```
# .gitattributes
*.txt text
*.jpg binary
*.sh text eol=lf
*.bat text eol=crlf
```

This ensures:

- Text files have normalized line endings
- JPG files are treated as binary
- Shell scripts always use LF endings (for Unix)
- Batch files always use CRLF endings (for Windows)

### Defining Custom Diff and Merge Strategies

For specific file types:

```
*.png diff=image
*.docx diff=word
```

You'll need to configure these diff drivers:

```bash
git config diff.image.textconv exiftool
git config diff.word.textconv docx2txt
```

Now `git diff` will show meaningful differences for these file types.

## Bundle and Archive

### Creating Portable Git Repositories

Bundle creates a single file containing all commits and references:

```bash
git bundle create repo.bundle HEAD main
```

To clone from a bundle:

```bash
git clone repo.bundle -b main new-repo
```

This is useful for transferring Git data without a network connection.

### Creating Archives of Your Code

To create a ZIP archive of your project:

```bash
git archive --format=zip HEAD > project.zip
```

To archive a specific tag:

```bash
git archive --format=zip v1.0.0 > project-v1.0.0.zip
```

To include submodules:

```bash
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git archive --prefix=$path/ --format=zip HEAD > $PWD/submodule-$name.zip'
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuring Git for Productivity

Some helpful configuration settings:

```bash
# Auto-correct typos in Git commands
git config --global help.autocorrect 20

# Show branch names in commit logs
git config --global log.decorate true

# Cache credentials
git config --global credential.helper cache

# Set a global .gitignore
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Use delta for improved diffs
git config --global core.pager "delta"

# Automatically prune deleted remote branches on fetch/pull
git config --global fetch.prune true
```

### Aliases for Advanced Workflows

Setting up complex aliases:

```bash
# Undo the last commit but keep changes staged
git config --global alias.uncommit 'reset --soft HEAD^'

# Interactive rebase for cleanup
git config --global alias.cleanup 'rebase -i @{upstream}'

# Visualize log with graph
git config --global alias.graph 'log --graph --oneline --decorate --all'

# Show all configs
git config --global alias.aliases 'config --get-regexp ^alias\.'

# Clean up merged branches
git config --global alias.clean-branches '!git branch --merged | grep -v "\*" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d'
```

## Git Internals

### Understanding Git Objects

Git stores four types of objects:

1. **Blob**: Content of a file
2. **Tree**: Directory listing, containing blobs and other trees
3. **Commit**: Points to a tree, with metadata
4. **Tag**: An object pointing to a specific commit

You can examine these objects:

```bash
# View a blob
git cat-file -p blob_hash

# View a tree
git cat-file -p tree_hash

# View a commit
git cat-file -p commit_hash

# View an object's type
git cat-file -t object_hash
```

### Git References

References (refs) are pointers to commits. They're stored in `.git/refs/`:

- Branches: `.git/refs/heads/`
- Tags: `.git/refs/tags/`
- Remote branches: `.git/refs/remotes/`

View the commit a reference points to:

```bash
git rev-parse main
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse --verify v1.0.0
```

### Custom Scripts Using Git Plumbing Commands

Git's low-level "plumbing" commands can be used to build custom tools:

A script to find large objects in your Git repository:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# find-large-objects.sh

# Create a temporary pack
git gc --quiet --prune=now

# Find the 10 largest objects
git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/*.idx |
  grep -v chain |
  sort -k3nr |
  head -10 |
  while read hash type size remainder; do
    if [ $size -gt 100000 ]; then
      echo "$size bytes: $(git cat-file -t $hash) $hash"
      git rev-list --all --objects | grep $hash | sed 's/^.*\t//'
    fi
  done
```

## Git for Specialized Workflows

### Monorepos with Git

For managing large monorepos:

- Use sparse checkout to work with subsets of the repo:

  ```bash
  git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/username/monorepo.git
  cd monorepo
  git sparse-checkout set path/to/subdirectory1 path/to/subdirectory2
  git checkout main
  ```

- Consider partial clones to reduce download size:

  ```bash
  git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/username/monorepo.git
  ```

- Use tools like Git LFS for large binary files

### Git for Continuous Integration/Deployment

In CI/CD pipelines, optimize Git operations:

- Use shallow clones to speed up the process:

  ```bash
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/username/repo.git
  ```

- Fetch only the necessary branches:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
  ```

- Use Git's built-in functionality to check for changes in specific directories:
  ```bash
  if git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -q "^frontend/"; then
    run_frontend_tests
  fi
  ```

### Git for Data Science and ML

For data science projects:

- Use Git LFS for large model files and datasets
- Consider tools like DVC (Data Version Control) for data and ML model versioning
- Create hooks to prevent committing sensitive data or large untracked files
- Use branch naming conventions that reflect experiments (e.g., `experiment/feature-selection-1`)
