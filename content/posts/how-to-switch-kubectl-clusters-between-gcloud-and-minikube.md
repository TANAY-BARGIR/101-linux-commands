## Introduction

Switching between Kubernetes clusters managed by gcloud and minikube can be a common task for developers working in diverse environments. In this guide, you'll learn how to use `kubectl` commands to switch clusters efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure:

- You have `kubectl` installed and configured.
- You have access to both gcloud and minikube clusters.

## Switching Clusters

### View Current Context

To check the current cluster context, use:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

This command displays the name of the cluster you are currently connected to.

### List Available Contexts

To view all available contexts, use:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This command lists all configured clusters and their contexts.

### Switch to gcloud Cluster

To switch to a gcloud cluster, use:

```bash
kubectl config use-context <gcloud-context-name>
```

Replace `<gcloud-context-name>` with the name of your gcloud cluster context.

### Switch to minikube Cluster

To switch to a minikube cluster, use:

```bash
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

The context name for minikube is typically `minikube`.

## Best Practices

- **Use Descriptive Context Names**: When setting up clusters, use clear and descriptive names for contexts.
- **Automate Switching**: Use scripts or aliases to automate context switching for frequent tasks.
- **Validate Context**: After switching, use `kubectl get nodes` to ensure you are connected to the correct cluster.

## Conclusion

Switching between gcloud and minikube clusters is straightforward with `kubectl`. By following these steps, you can efficiently manage multiple Kubernetes environments.
