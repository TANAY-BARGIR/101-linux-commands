If you've spent any time dealing with networking in software development or DevOps, you've likely seen the terms **port** and **socket**. They're related, but they aren't the same thing.

Understanding the difference can help you debug connectivity issues, configure servers, and write networked applications more confidently.

## What Is a Port?

A **port** is a logical number assigned to a specific service or application on a machine. It helps the operating system route incoming and outgoing traffic to the correct process.

Think of your computer like a large office building, and ports are the numbered rooms inside it. Just like mail needs a room number to reach the right person, network traffic needs a port number to reach the correct application.

Ports are always associated with a protocol like TCP or UDP. For example:

- Port 22 (TCP): SSH
- Port 80 (TCP): HTTP
- Port 443 (TCP): HTTPS
- Port 3306 (TCP): MySQL

Ports range from 0 to 65535. Ports below 1024 are considered _privileged_ and usually require elevated permissions to bind to.

## What Is a Socket?

A **socket** is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network. It includes more than just the port, it's a combination of several pieces of information:

```
<protocol>, <local IP address>, <local port>, <remote IP address>, <remote port>
```

This 5-part combination is often referred to as a **socket tuple**.

For example, a socket might look like this:

```
TCP, 192.168.1.5, 51734, 93.184.216.34, 80
```

This describes a TCP connection from your local machine on port `51734` to a remote web server (`93.184.216.34`) on port `80`.

A socket represents an actual connection, while a port is just an address that can accept or initiate connections.

## How They Work Together

When your machine runs a server (like a web app on port 3000), it listens on a specific port. That port doesn't do anything on its own, it becomes useful when a socket is created, which involves:

- Choosing a local port (like 3000)
- Listening for connections from remote addresses
- Creating a socket for each new connection

On the client side, your browser creates a socket with a random local port, connects to the remote IP and port, and establishes a TCP socket.

Here's a simplified flow:

```text
Client creates socket → OS assigns random local port
→ Connects to server IP + server port (e.g. 443)
→ Server accepts and creates a socket for the session
→ Data is exchanged through both sockets
```

## Checking Sockets and Ports in Action

On macOS or Linux, you can see active sockets with:

```bash
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
```

To list all ports being listened to:

```bash
sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
```

This helps you identify which apps are bound to which ports, and what sockets are actively being used.

## Common Confusion

Here are some things that often trip people up:

- **A port is not a process.** Multiple apps can't listen on the same port at the same time (on the same IP), but many sockets can use the same port if the connections are unique.
- **A socket includes the remote side.** That's what makes it a unique connection.
- **You can't bind two servers to the same port on the same IP.** You'll get an "address already in use" error.

When you're building or debugging networked applications, knowing how ports and sockets differ helps you understand how data flows between systems.

Next time you're wondering why a service isn't accepting traffic or why your app crashes with an `EADDRINUSE` error, you'll know exactly where to look.
