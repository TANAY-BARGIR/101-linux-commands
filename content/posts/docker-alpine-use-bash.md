## TLDR

Alpine Linux images use `sh` (BusyBox shell) by default, not bash. To use bash, install it with `apk add --no-cache bash` in your Dockerfile or at runtime. Then you can run scripts or open an interactive bash shell as needed.

## Why Alpine Uses sh Instead of bash

Alpine is designed to be lightweight and secure, so it ships with BusyBox's `sh` shell by default. This keeps images small, but means bash isn't available unless you add it yourself.

## How to Install bash in an Alpine Container

Add this line to your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN apk add --no-cache bash
```

**Example Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20
RUN apk add --no-cache bash
CMD ["bash"]
```

Or, for a one-off interactive session:

```zsh
docker run -it alpine:3.20 sh
# Inside the container:
apk add --no-cache bash
bash
```

## Running Scripts with bash

If your script uses bash features (like arrays or advanced syntax), make sure to:

- Install bash as above
- Use `#!/bin/bash` as the shebang in your script
- Run the script with `bash script.sh` or make it executable

## Best Practices

- Only install bash if you need it—stick with sh for simple scripts to keep images small
- For multi-stage builds, install bash only in build stages if possible
- Document the shell requirements for your scripts

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `bash: not found`, install it with `apk add --no-cache bash`
- If your script fails with syntax errors, check the shebang and shell compatibility

## Conclusion

To use bash in Alpine-based Docker images, just install it with apk and use it as needed. This gives you access to familiar bash features while keeping your images lean and efficient.
