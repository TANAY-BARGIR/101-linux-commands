## TLDR

Most Docker containers run as root by default, so you usually don't need `sudo` to run privileged commands. If you want to use `sudo` (for multi-user images or extra security), you'll need to install it and configure users. This guide shows how, with practical examples and best practices.

## Why Isn't sudo Available by Default?

Docker containers are designed to be lightweight and secure. By default, most images run as root, so you can install packages or modify the system without `sudo`. Many base images (like Alpine, Ubuntu, Debian) don't include `sudo` to keep images small.

## Running as Root (No sudo Needed)

If your container runs as root (the default), just run commands directly:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
CMD ["bash"]
```

Inside the container:

```bash
# You're already root
apt-get update
```

## Adding sudo to a Container

If you want to use `sudo` (for example, to switch between users or for development parity), you need to install it and set up users:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y sudo
RUN useradd -m devuser && echo "devuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
USER devuser
CMD ["bash"]
```

Now, inside the container:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

This works just like on a regular Linux system.

## When Should You Use sudo in Docker?

- **Development images:** To mimic a real user environment or test scripts that require sudo.
- **Multi-user containers:** If your container runs as a non-root user but needs to escalate privileges for some tasks.
- **Security best practices:** For production, it's better to run as a non-root user and only use sudo when absolutely necessary.

## Best Practices

- Avoid running production containers as root unless required.
- Only install `sudo` if you need it—otherwise, keep images minimal.
- Use the `USER` directive in your Dockerfile to specify a non-root user.
- For one-off commands, you can override the user at runtime:

```bash
docker run -u root my-image whoami
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `sudo: command not found`, install it in your Dockerfile.
- If you get permission errors, check your user and group settings.
- For Alpine images, use `apk add sudo` instead of `apt-get install sudo`.

## Conclusion

You rarely need `sudo` in Docker containers, since most run as root by default. If you do need it, install and configure it in your Dockerfile, and use the `USER` directive for better security. Keep your images minimal and only add what you need for your use case.
