You try to redirect output to a system file with `sudo echo "text" > /etc/config`, and you get "Permission denied". What gives? You used `sudo`!

## TL;DR

The redirect (`>`) is handled by your shell before `sudo` runs, so it happens with your user permissions, not root. To fix this, use one of these approaches: `echo "text" | sudo tee /etc/config`, or `sudo sh -c 'echo "text" > /etc/config'`, or `sudo bash -c 'echo "text" > /etc/config'`. The `tee` method is usually the simplest and safest.

This is one of the most common stumbling blocks when working with Linux permissions. The key is understanding the order of operations: your shell processes redirects before executing commands.

Let's say you want to add a line to `/etc/hosts`, which is owned by root. You might try:

```bash
sudo echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.local" > /etc/hosts
```

But you get:

```
bash: /etc/hosts: Permission denied
```

Here's what actually happens:

```
Step 1: Shell sees the redirect '>' and opens /etc/hosts for writing
        (This happens as your user, not as root)

Step 2: Shell tries to open /etc/hosts with your permissions
        Result: Permission denied

Step 3: sudo echo never runs because step 2 failed
```

The `sudo` only applies to the `echo` command, not the redirect. Your shell opens the output file before `sudo` even gets involved.

## Method 1: Using tee with sudo

The `tee` command reads from standard input and writes to both standard output and files. When you combine it with `sudo`, the file writing happens with elevated privileges:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

The `-a` flag appends to the file instead of overwriting it. Without `-a`, `tee` truncates the file first:

```bash
# Overwrites /etc/config
echo "new content" | sudo tee /etc/config

# Appends to /etc/config
echo "new line" | sudo tee -a /etc/config
```

By default, `tee` also prints the content to stdout. If you don't want to see the output in your terminal, redirect it to `/dev/null`:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null
```

Notice that the redirect to `/dev/null` happens in your shell (not as root), but that's fine because anyone can write to `/dev/null`.

## Method 2: Using a Shell with sudo

Another approach is to run a complete shell command with `sudo`, including the redirect:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.local" >> /etc/hosts'
```

The `-c` flag tells `sh` to execute the command string. Now the redirect happens inside the sudo'd shell, so it runs with root privileges.

You can use `bash` instead of `sh` if you need bash-specific features:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
```

This method is useful when you need more complex operations:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'echo "# Added by deployment script" >> /etc/config && echo "option=value" >> /etc/config'
```

## Method 3: Using dd

The `dd` command can also write to files with sudo:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.local" | sudo dd of=/etc/hosts oflag=append conv=notrunc
```

This is more verbose than `tee`, but it's useful if you need `dd`'s features like block-level control. The options mean:
- `of=/etc/hosts`: Output file
- `oflag=append`: Append mode (like `>>`)
- `conv=notrunc`: Don't truncate the file

For most cases, `tee` is simpler and more readable.

## Practical Example: Updating System Configuration

Let's say you're writing a script to configure a new server. You need to update several system files:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Add a custom DNS entry
echo "10.0.0.50 database.internal" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null

# Configure sysctl settings
echo "net.core.somaxconn = 65535" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf > /dev/null
echo "net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8192" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf > /dev/null

# Apply sysctl changes
sudo sysctl -p

echo "System configuration updated"
```

This script appends to system files safely, and the changes persist across reboots.

## Writing Multiple Lines

If you need to write multiple lines, you have several options. Using `tee` with a here-document:

```bash
sudo tee -a /etc/config > /dev/null <<EOF
option1=value1
option2=value2
option3=value3
EOF
```

Or using `sh -c` with a here-document:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'cat >> /etc/config <<EOF
option1=value1
option2=value2
option3=value3
EOF'
```

The `tee` approach is usually cleaner for multi-line content.

## Appending vs Overwriting

Be very careful about the difference between `>` (overwrite) and `>>` (append).

Overwriting replaces the entire file:

```bash
# DANGER: This erases all existing content in /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" | sudo tee /etc/hosts
```

Appending adds to the end:

```bash
# Safe: This adds a line to the end of /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

When working with system configuration files, you almost always want to append (`-a` with `tee`, or `>>` with `sh -c`).

## Creating a Backup First

Before modifying system files, create a backup:

```bash
# Create a backup with timestamp
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Then make your change
echo "127.0.0.1 myapp.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null
```

For scripts, add backup logic:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

CONFIG_FILE="/etc/myapp.conf"
BACKUP_FILE="${CONFIG_FILE}.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Create backup if file exists
if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
    sudo cp "$CONFIG_FILE" "$BACKUP_FILE"
    echo "Backup created: $BACKUP_FILE"
fi

# Now safe to modify
echo "new_option=value" | sudo tee -a "$CONFIG_FILE" > /dev/null
```

## Reading and Writing in One Command

Sometimes you need to read a protected file, modify it, and write it back. You can combine tools:

```bash
# Remove commented lines and write back
sudo cat /etc/config | grep -v '^#' | sudo tee /etc/config.new > /dev/null
sudo mv /etc/config.new /etc/config
```

Or use `sed` with `sudo`:

```bash
# Replace all occurrences of 'old' with 'new' in a system file
sudo sed -i 's/old/new/g' /etc/config
```

The `-i` flag tells `sed` to edit the file in place, and `sudo` gives it permission to do so.

## Writing to Files in /proc or /sys

The `/proc` and `/sys` filesystems expose kernel parameters as files. You can't use normal file editing tools on them, but you can write to them using redirects:

```bash
# Enable IP forwarding
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward > /dev/null

# Or with sh -c
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'
```

These changes take effect immediately but don't persist across reboots. To make them permanent, add them to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf > /dev/null
```

## Common Mistakes

Here are some things that won't work:

```bash
# Won't work - redirect happens before sudo
sudo echo "text" > /etc/config

# Won't work - sudo only applies to cat
sudo cat file.txt > /etc/config

# Won't work - quote issues with sh -c
sudo sh -c echo "text" > /etc/config  # The > is outside the quoted command

# Won't work - trying to use sudo inside a redirect
echo "text" > sudo /etc/config
```

The working versions:

```bash
# Works - tee runs with sudo
echo "text" | sudo tee /etc/config

# Works - redirect is inside the sudo'd command
sudo sh -c 'echo "text" > /etc/config'

# Works - cat and redirect both inside sudo'd shell
sudo sh -c 'cat file.txt > /etc/config'
```

## Which Method Should You Use?

For simple cases where you're writing or appending content, use `tee`:

```bash
echo "content" | sudo tee -a /etc/file
```

For complex operations involving multiple commands or bash features, use `sh -c` or `bash -c`:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'for i in {1..5}; do echo "line $i" >> /etc/file; done'
```

For editing files in place, use `sed` or other editors with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/pattern/replacement/' /etc/file
```

Understanding how shells handle redirects before executing commands is key to working with `sudo` effectively. The `tee` command is your friend for simple writes, while `sh -c` or `bash -c` give you full control for complex operations.
