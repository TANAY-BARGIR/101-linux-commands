Sometimes you need to check which remote server your local Git repository is connected to. Maybe you've cloned several projects and forgot which fork you're working with, or you're debugging connection issues and need to verify the remote URL. Git stores this information in your repository configuration, and you can access it with a few simple commands.

## TLDR

Run `git remote -v` to see all remote URLs for your repository. The `origin` remote typically shows where you originally cloned from. For just the URL, use `git config --get remote.origin.url`.

## Prerequisites

You need a local Git repository that was cloned from a remote source. If you initialized the repository locally without cloning, it won't have any remote URLs unless you've added them manually.

## Quick Method: View All Remotes

The fastest way to see your remote repository URLs is:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This shows all configured remotes with their URLs. You'll typically see output like:

```
origin  git@github.com:username/project-name.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/project-name.git (push)
```

The `-v` flag stands for "verbose" and displays both the remote name and its URL. Most repositories have at least one remote called `origin`, which is the default name Git assigns to the remote you cloned from.

## Understanding Remote Names

When you clone a repository, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin` that points to the source repository:

```bash
# When you clone a repository
git clone git@github.com:username/project-name.git

# Git automatically sets up 'origin' as the remote
```

But repositories can have multiple remotes. For example, if you're contributing to an open source project, you might have:

```
origin     git@github.com:your-username/project-name.git (fetch)
origin     git@github.com:your-username/project-name.git (push)
upstream   git@github.com:original-owner/project-name.git (fetch)
upstream   git@github.com:original-owner/project-name.git (push)
```

In this setup:
- `origin` points to your fork
- `upstream` points to the original repository you forked from

## Getting a Specific Remote URL

If you want just the URL without extra formatting, use git config:

```bash
# Get the origin remote URL
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

This outputs only the URL:

```
git@github.com:username/project-name.git
```

This is useful when you need the URL for scripts or when piping the output to other commands.

For a different remote, replace `origin` with the remote name:

```bash
# Get upstream remote URL
git config --get remote.upstream.url
```

## Checking Remote URLs from the Config File

Git stores remote information in your repository's configuration file. You can view it directly:

```bash
# View the entire config file
cat .git/config
```

Look for sections like this:

```
[remote "origin"]
    url = git@github.com:username/project-name.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```

This shows not just the URL but also the fetch configuration for that remote.

You can also use git config to view all remote settings:

```bash
# Show all remote-related configuration
git config --get-regexp remote.*
```

Output:

```
remote.origin.url git@github.com:username/project-name.git
remote.origin.fetch +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```

## Distinguishing Between HTTPS and SSH URLs

Remote URLs come in two main formats:

**HTTPS format:**
```
https://github.com/username/project-name.git
```

**SSH format:**
```
git@github.com:username/project-name.git
```

The format affects how you authenticate:
- HTTPS typically uses username and password or personal access token
- SSH uses SSH keys

To see which you're using:

```bash
git remote -v
```

If you want to switch from one format to another, you can change the URL:

```bash
# Switch from HTTPS to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git

# Switch from SSH to HTTPS
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/project-name.git
```

## Working with Multiple Remotes

In some workflows, you'll have multiple remotes configured. Here's how to navigate them:

```bash
# List all remote names
git remote

# Get detailed info about a specific remote
git remote show origin
```

The `git remote show` command provides comprehensive information:

```
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:username/project-name.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:username/project-name.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branches:
    main     tracked
    develop  tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (up to date)
```

This shows:
- Fetch and push URLs (they can be different)
- Which remote branches Git knows about
- How your local branches relate to remote branches

## When Fetch and Push URLs Differ

Sometimes repositories have different URLs for fetching and pushing:

```bash
# Set different URLs for fetch and push
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git
git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git
```

Check if you have different URLs:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You might see:

```
origin  https://github.com/username/project-name.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/project-name.git (push)
```

This setup lets you fetch via HTTPS (which works through firewalls more reliably) but push via SSH (which is often more convenient with key-based authentication).

## Handling Repositories Without Remotes

If you initialized a repository locally without cloning, you won't have any remotes:

```bash
git init my-project
cd my-project
git remote -v
# No output - no remotes configured
```

To add a remote to an existing local repository:

```bash
# Add a remote called origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git

# Verify it was added
git remote -v
```

## Troubleshooting Remote URL Issues

If you're having connection problems, check these common issues:

**Problem: Wrong URL format**

```bash
# Check current URL
git remote -v

# If it's wrong, update it
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:correct-user/correct-repo.git
```

**Problem: Remote doesn't exist**

```bash
# Try to fetch to test connectivity
git fetch origin

# If it fails, verify the URL is correct
git remote -v
```

**Problem: Permission denied**

Check if you're using the right authentication method:

```bash
# For SSH, test your connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# For HTTPS, you might need to update credentials
```

## Using Remote URLs in Scripts

When writing scripts, you often need to extract the remote URL:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the origin URL
REPO_URL=$(git config --get remote.origin.url)

# Extract just the repository name
REPO_NAME=$(basename -s .git "$REPO_URL")

echo "Working with repository: $REPO_NAME"
echo "Remote URL: $REPO_URL"
```

This is useful for automation tasks like:
- Cloning related repositories
- Building CI/CD pipelines
- Creating backup scripts
- Generating documentation

## Verifying Remote Repository Access

Before pushing or pulling, you might want to verify you can access the remote:

```bash
# Test connectivity to the remote
git ls-remote origin
```

This lists all references in the remote repository. If it succeeds, you have access. If it fails, you'll see authentication or connection errors that help diagnose the problem.

Now you know how to find your repository's remote URLs and work with them effectively. This knowledge is particularly useful when managing multiple repositories, troubleshooting connection issues, or setting up complex workflows with multiple remotes.
