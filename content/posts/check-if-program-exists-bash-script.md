When writing Bash scripts, you often need to verify that required programs or commands are available before attempting to use them. This prevents scripts from failing with "command not found" errors and allows you to provide helpful error messages or install missing dependencies.

This guide covers several reliable methods to check for program availability, along with their advantages and best practices for different scenarios.

## Using the command Built-in (Recommended)

The most portable and reliable way to check if a program exists is using the `command` built-in with the `-v` option:

```bash
if command -v git &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Git is installed"
else
    echo "Git is not installed"
fi
```

The `command -v` approach works because:

- It's a POSIX-compliant built-in available in all shells
- It checks the PATH for executables, shell built-ins, and functions
- It returns a non-zero exit code if the command isn't found
- It doesn't execute the command, just checks availability

Here's a practical function to check for multiple programs:

```bash
check_dependencies() {
    local dependencies=("$@")
    local missing=()

    for cmd in "${dependencies[@]}"; do
        if ! command -v "$cmd" &> /dev/null; then
            missing+=("$cmd")
        fi
    done

    if [ ${#missing[@]} -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Missing dependencies: ${missing[*]}"
        return 1
    fi

    return 0
}

# Usage
if check_dependencies git curl jq; then
    echo "All dependencies are available"
else
    echo "Please install missing dependencies"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Using the which Command

The `which` command is another common approach, but it has some limitations:

```bash
if which python3 &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Python 3 is installed"
else
    echo "Python 3 is not installed"
fi
```

However, `which` has drawbacks:

- It's not available on all systems by default
- It doesn't detect shell built-ins or functions
- Some systems have different implementations with varying behavior

Use `which` only when you specifically need to find the full path to an executable:

```bash
python_path=$(which python3)
if [ -n "$python_path" ]; then
    echo "Python 3 found at: $python_path"
else
    echo "Python 3 not found"
fi
```

## Using the type Built-in

The `type` built-in provides detailed information about commands:

```bash
if type git &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Git is available"
    type git  # Shows what type of command it is
else
    echo "Git is not available"
fi
```

The `type` command can tell you whether something is:

- An executable file
- A shell built-in
- A function
- An alias

This is useful when you need to understand how a command will be interpreted:

```bash
check_command_type() {
    local cmd="$1"

    if type "$cmd" &> /dev/null; then
        local cmd_type=$(type -t "$cmd")
        case "$cmd_type" in
            "file")
                echo "$cmd is an executable file"
                ;;
            "builtin")
                echo "$cmd is a shell built-in"
                ;;
            "function")
                echo "$cmd is a function"
                ;;
            "alias")
                echo "$cmd is an alias"
                ;;
        esac
        return 0
    else
        echo "$cmd is not available"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

## Checking for Specific Executables

Sometimes you need to check for a specific executable file, not just any command:

```bash
check_executable() {
    local cmd="$1"
    local path=$(command -v "$cmd")

    if [ -n "$path" ] && [ -x "$path" ]; then
        echo "$cmd is executable at $path"
        return 0
    else
        echo "$cmd is not available as an executable"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

## Checking Multiple Locations

For programs that might be installed in non-standard locations:

```bash
find_program() {
    local program="$1"
    local locations=(
        "/usr/bin/$program"
        "/usr/local/bin/$program"
        "/opt/bin/$program"
        "$HOME/bin/$program"
    )

    # First check PATH
    if command -v "$program" &> /dev/null; then
        command -v "$program"
        return 0
    fi

    # Then check specific locations
    for location in "${locations[@]}"; do
        if [ -x "$location" ]; then
            echo "$location"
            return 0
        fi
    done

    return 1
}

# Usage
if program_path=$(find_program "custom-tool"); then
    echo "Found custom-tool at: $program_path"
else
    echo "custom-tool not found"
fi
```

## Version Checking

Often you need to verify not just that a program exists, but that it meets version requirements:

```bash
check_git_version() {
    if ! command -v git &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Git is not installed"
        return 1
    fi

    local version=$(git --version | awk '{print $3}')
    local required="2.20.0"

    if [ "$(printf '%s\n' "$required" "$version" | sort -V | head -n1)" = "$required" ]; then
        echo "Git version $version meets requirements"
        return 0
    else
        echo "Git version $version is too old (required: $required)"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

## Creating a Comprehensive Dependency Checker

Here's a complete function that combines all the best practices:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

check_program() {
    local program="$1"
    local required_version="$2"
    local install_hint="$3"

    # Check if program exists
    if ! command -v "$program" &> /dev/null; then
        echo "❌ $program is not installed"
        if [ -n "$install_hint" ]; then
            echo "   Install with: $install_hint"
        fi
        return 1
    fi

    echo "✅ $program is available"

    # Check version if specified
    if [ -n "$required_version" ]; then
        case "$program" in
            "git")
                version=$(git --version | awk '{print $3}')
                ;;
            "python3")
                version=$(python3 --version | awk '{print $2}')
                ;;
            "node")
                version=$(node --version | sed 's/v//')
                ;;
            *)
                echo "   (Version check not implemented for $program)"
                return 0
                ;;
        esac

        if [ "$(printf '%s\n' "$required_version" "$version" | sort -V | head -n1)" = "$required_version" ]; then
            echo "   Version $version meets requirement (>= $required_version)"
        else
            echo "   ❌ Version $version is too old (required: >= $required_version)"
            return 1
        fi
    fi

    return 0
}

# Main dependency check
main() {
    echo "Checking dependencies..."
    local all_good=true

    check_program "git" "2.20.0" "sudo apt install git" || all_good=false
    check_program "curl" "" "sudo apt install curl" || all_good=false
    check_program "jq" "" "sudo apt install jq" || all_good=false
    check_program "python3" "3.8.0" "sudo apt install python3" || all_good=false

    if [ "$all_good" = true ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "✅ All dependencies are satisfied!"
        return 0
    else
        echo ""
        echo "❌ Some dependencies are missing or outdated"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Run the check
if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" = "${0}" ]; then
    main "$@"
fi
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `command -v` for most cases** - It's the most portable and reliable method
2. **Suppress output with `&> /dev/null`** - Keep your checks clean
3. **Provide helpful error messages** - Tell users how to install missing programs
4. **Check early in your script** - Fail fast if dependencies are missing
5. **Consider version requirements** - Some scripts need specific versions
6. **Group dependency checks** - Check all requirements before starting work

Checking for program availability is a crucial part of writing robust Bash scripts. Using the right method for your specific needs ensures your scripts work reliably across different systems and provide helpful feedback when requirements aren't met.
