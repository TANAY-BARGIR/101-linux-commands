DevOps isn't just about shipping code faster, it's about doing it smarter, safer, and saner. But let's be real: even the best teams make mistakes. Some are harmless. Others take down production on a Friday afternoon (yes, _that_ Friday deploy).

Here are 10 common DevOps mistakes in 2025, how to avoid them, and a few moments that might hit a little too close to home.

## 1. Treating Infrastructure as Code Like a One-Off Script

You wrote Terraform once, it worked, and now it lives untouched in a dusty repo folder. That's not IaC, that's tech debt.

**Avoid it**:

- Version control your IaC.
- Apply formatting and linting.
- Test it with tools like `terraform plan` or `terratest`.

---

## 2. Not Enforcing Version Control on CI/CD Configs

Your pipeline files are changing, but without versioning, there's no easy way to debug regressions.

**Avoid it**:

- Store all CI/CD config files (like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) in version control.
- Treat pipeline logic like any other critical code.

## 3. Poor Secrets Management

Hardcoding secrets in code or using `.env` files without encryption is a fast way to land on HN for the wrong reasons.

**Avoid it**:

- Use Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, or SOPS.
- Rotate secrets regularly.

---

## 4. No Rollback Strategy

You deploy. Something breaks. And there's no plan B.

**Avoid it**:

- Use blue-green or canary deployments.
- Automate rollbacks on failure.
- Always have a `rollback.sh` or previous image ready.

## 5. Ignoring Observability Until It's Too Late

Monitoring isn't just about uptime. You can't fix what you can't see.

**Avoid it**:

- Add metrics, logs, and traces from day one.
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry.

## 6. Too Many Tools, Not Enough Integration

Your stack has 25 tools. None of them talk to each other. And your alert fatigue is real.

**Avoid it**:

- Consolidate tools where possible.
- Favor tools that integrate well with your existing stack.

---

## 7. Manual Approval for Every Tiny Change

A typo fix shouldn't need a 3-person review and a Slack war.

**Avoid it**:

- Set up clear policies: auto-approve safe changes, gate critical ones.
- Use GitHub environments, OPA, or custom bots to help.

## 8. No Documentation = Single Point of Failure

"Ask Alex, they built it." Alex is on vacation.

**Avoid it**:

- Write docs as you go.
- Use tools like Backstage, Docusaurus, or just plain Markdown.
- Encourage a culture of async knowledge sharing.

---

## 9. Skipping Tests for Infrastructure Changes

You test app code, but deploy infra changes directly to prod? Bold.

**Avoid it**:

- Use staging or preview environments.
- Test IaC with `checkov`, `terratest`, or `kitchen`.

---

## 10. Forgetting Security in Your Pipelines

If your pipeline can deploy to prod, attackers might be able to as well.

**Avoid it**:

- Use least privilege for pipeline credentials.
- Run security checks like `trivy`, `semgrep`, and `snyk`.
