Docker containers run in isolated network environments by default, which means services running inside containers aren't accessible from your host machine or the outside world without explicit port forwarding. Understanding how to map ports between your host and containers is essential for accessing web applications, databases, APIs, and other containerized services.

This guide covers everything you need to know about Docker port forwarding, from basic mapping to advanced scenarios.

## TLDR

Use `-p` or `--publish` to forward ports when running a container: `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx` maps host port 8080 to container port 80. Use `-p 127.0.0.1:8080:80` to bind only to localhost. For running containers, you must commit and restart with new port mappings. Use `docker-compose` for complex port configurations.

## Prerequisites

You need Docker installed and basic familiarity with running containers. Understanding of network ports and how services listen on ports will help.

## Basic Port Forwarding

The `-p` flag maps a host port to a container port.

### Syntax

```bash
docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image>
```

Example - running Nginx:

```bash
# Map host port 8080 to container port 80
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Now access Nginx at `http://localhost:8080` on your host machine. Inside the container, Nginx listens on port 80, but you access it via 8080 on your host.

### Multiple Port Mappings

Map multiple ports with multiple `-p` flags:

```bash
# Map both HTTP and HTTPS
docker run -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 nginx
```

Or forward a range of ports:

```bash
# Map ports 8080-8090 to 80-90
docker run -p 8080-8090:80-90 myapp
```

## Publishing All Exposed Ports

Images can declare ports with `EXPOSE` in their Dockerfile. Use `-P` (capital P) to automatically map all exposed ports to random high ports on the host:

```bash
docker run -P nginx
```

Check which ports were assigned:

```bash
docker ps
```

Output:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE    PORTS                    NAMES
abc123def456   nginx    0.0.0.0:32768->80/tcp    eager_morse
```

Nginx's port 80 is mapped to host port 32768.

Find the actual port programmatically:

```bash
docker port <container-name> 80
```

Output:

```
0.0.0.0:32768
```

## Binding to Specific Interfaces

By default, `-p 8080:80` binds to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), making the service accessible from anywhere. Bind to specific interfaces for security:

### Localhost Only

```bash
# Only accessible from the host machine
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 nginx
```

Now `http://localhost:8080` works, but external machines can't connect.

### Specific IP Address

```bash
# Bind to specific network interface
docker run -p 192.168.1.100:8080:80 nginx
```

The service is only accessible via the specified IP address.

## UDP Port Forwarding

Specify the protocol for UDP services:

```bash
# Forward UDP port
docker run -p 5353:53/udp dns-server

# Forward both TCP and UDP
docker run -p 8080:80/tcp -p 5353:53/udp myapp
```

## Docker Compose Port Mapping

In `docker-compose.yml`, use the `ports` section:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
      - "8443:443"

  database:
    image: postgres
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"

  app:
    image: myapp
    ports:
      - "3000-3005:3000-3005"
```

Start services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

All port mappings are applied automatically.

### Short vs Long Syntax

Docker Compose supports both syntaxes:

**Short syntax:**
```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:80"
  - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"
```

**Long syntax (more explicit):**
```yaml
ports:
  - target: 80        # Container port
    published: 8080   # Host port
    protocol: tcp
    mode: host

  - target: 5432
    published: 5432
    host_ip: 127.0.0.1
```

## Adding Ports to Running Containers

You cannot add port forwarding to a running container directly. You must stop, commit, and restart with new port mappings.

### Method 1: Commit and Restart

```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop mycontainer

# Commit current state to new image
docker commit mycontainer myapp-with-data

# Remove old container
docker rm mycontainer

# Run with new port mapping
docker run -p 8080:80 --name mycontainer myapp-with-data
```

### Method 2: iptables Port Forwarding

Forward ports using iptables without restarting:

```bash
# Get container IP
CONTAINER_IP=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' mycontainer)

# Forward host port 8080 to container port 80
sudo iptables -t nat -A DOCKER -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination ${CONTAINER_IP}:80

# Allow the forwarded traffic
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE -p tcp --source ${CONTAINER_IP} --destination ${CONTAINER_IP} --dport 80
```

This forwards traffic without restarting the container, but the mapping is lost when Docker restarts.

### Method 3: Docker Proxy

Use a reverse proxy container (like Nginx or Traefik) to route traffic to containers without direct port mappings:

```bash
# Run application without port mapping
docker run --name myapp myimage

# Run nginx-proxy
docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy

# nginx-proxy automatically detects containers and proxies to them
```

## Checking Port Mappings

View port mappings for a running container:

```bash
# Using docker ps
docker ps

# Using docker port
docker port <container-name>

# Using docker inspect
docker inspect <container-name> | grep -A 20 "Ports"
```

Example output:

```json
"Ports": {
  "80/tcp": [
    {
      "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
      "HostPort": "8080"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Port Mapping Patterns

### Web Applications

```bash
# Frontend application
docker run -p 3000:3000 react-app

# Backend API
docker run -p 8000:8000 api-server

# Database (localhost only)
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 postgres
```

### Development Environment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"    # Web server
      - "35729:35729"  # Live reload
    volumes:
      - .:/app

  db:
    image: postgres
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"
```

### Microservices

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  api-gateway:
    image: api-gateway
    ports:
      - "80:8080"

  auth-service:
    image: auth-service
    # No external ports - only accessible via Docker network

  user-service:
    image: user-service
    # No external ports
```

Only the API gateway is exposed externally. Other services communicate via Docker's internal network.

## Troubleshooting Port Conflicts

### Port Already in Use

Error:

```
Error: bind: address already in use
```

Find what's using the port:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo lsof -i :8080

# Or use netstat
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :8080

# Or ss
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :8080
```

Solutions:

1. **Use a different host port:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8081:80 nginx
   ```

2. **Stop the conflicting service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop apache2
   docker run -p 80:80 nginx
   ```

3. **Kill the process using the port:**
   ```bash
   kill <PID>
   ```

### Container Port Not Responding

Check if the service inside the container is actually listening:

```bash
# Execute command in running container
docker exec mycontainer netstat -tlnp

# Or check if the port is open
docker exec mycontainer nc -zv localhost 80
```

If the service isn't running inside the container, the port mapping won't help.

### Firewall Blocking Access

If the container is accessible from localhost but not externally, check your firewall:

```bash
# Check if Docker added firewall rules
sudo iptables -L -n -v | grep 8080

# Allow the port through ufw
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp

# Or firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Docker Networks and Port Forwarding

Containers on the same Docker network can communicate without port forwarding:

```bash
# Create a network
docker network create mynetwork

# Run database (no port forwarding needed)
docker run --network mynetwork --name db postgres

# Run app (connects to 'db' by name)
docker run --network mynetwork --name app -p 8080:80 myapp
```

Inside `myapp`, connect to the database at `postgresql://db:5432` - no port forwarding needed because they're on the same network.

## Host Network Mode

Skip Docker networking entirely and use the host's network:

```bash
docker run --network host nginx
```

In host mode:
- No port mapping needed
- Container uses host ports directly
- Service on container port 80 is accessible at host port 80
- Less isolation but simpler networking

Use case: When you need maximum network performance or when port mapping overhead is a concern.

## Best Practices

**Don't expose databases publicly**: Always bind database ports to localhost:

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 postgres
```

**Use high ports for development**: Avoid ports below 1024 which require root:

```bash
# Good
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

# Requires sudo
sudo docker run -p 80:80 nginx
```

**Document your port mappings**: In your README or docker-compose.yml comments:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"  # Web UI
      - "9229:9229"  # Node.js debugger
      - "35729:35729"  # Live reload
```

**Use Docker Compose for complex setups**: It's easier to manage multiple port mappings in YAML than remembering long docker run commands.

**Plan your port allocation**: Maintain a list of ports used by different containers to avoid conflicts.

Port forwarding is fundamental to using Docker effectively. Whether you're running a simple web server or a complex microservices architecture, understanding how to map ports between your host and containers lets you expose services securely and accessibly. Use `-p` for basic mapping, Docker Compose for complex setups, and remember to bind sensitive services like databases to localhost only.
