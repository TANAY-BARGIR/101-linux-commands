## TLDR

To migrate Terraform state between projects, use the `terraform state pull` and `terraform state push` commands. This process involves exporting the state from the source project and importing it into the target project.

Terraform state files track the resources managed by your configurations. Migrating state between projects is necessary when splitting a monolithic configuration into smaller ones or consolidating multiple configurations. This guide will show you how to migrate Terraform state safely.

### Why Migrate State?

- **Modularity**: Split a large configuration into smaller, more manageable projects.
- **Collaboration**: Separate state files for different teams or environments.
- **Consolidation**: Merge multiple configurations into a single project.

### Steps to Migrate State

#### Step 1: Backup the State File

Before making any changes, create a backup of the state file to avoid accidental data loss.

```bash
terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate.backup
```

#### Step 2: Identify Resources to Migrate

List the resources in the state file to identify which ones need to be migrated.

```bash
terraform state list
```

#### Step 3: Remove Resources from the Source Project

Use the `terraform state rm` command to remove the resources from the source project.

```bash
terraform state rm aws_instance.example
```

#### Step 4: Import Resources into the Target Project

In the target project, use the `terraform import` command to add the resources to the new state file.

```bash
terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
```

#### Step 5: Verify the Migration

Run `terraform plan` in both projects to ensure the state migration was successful and no resources are missing.

### Best Practices

- **Use Remote State**: Store state files in a remote backend like S3 to simplify management.
- **Document Changes**: Keep a record of the migration process for future reference.
- **Test in Non-Production**: Validate the migration in a non-production environment before applying it to production.

By following these steps, you can safely migrate Terraform state between projects, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption to your infrastructure.
