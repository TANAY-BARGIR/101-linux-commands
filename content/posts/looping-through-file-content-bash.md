Processing file content line by line is a common requirement in Bash scripting, whether you're analyzing log files, processing configuration data, or batch-processing lists of items. Bash provides several methods to iterate through file content, each with specific advantages depending on your use case and the characteristics of your data.

## Prerequisites

You'll need access to a Linux terminal with basic Bash scripting knowledge. These examples work on all systems with Bash, including Linux distributions and macOS.

## Basic Line-by-Line Reading

The most straightforward approach uses a while loop with the `read` command. This script processes each line of a file:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Processing: $line"
done < input.txt
```

The `IFS=` prevents the shell from trimming whitespace, and `-r` prevents backslash interpretation. This combination preserves the original line content exactly as it appears in the file.

## Processing Files with Error Handling

Adding error handling makes your scripts more robust. This example checks if the file exists before processing:

```bash
filename="data.txt"

if [[ ! -f "$filename" ]]; then
    echo "Error: File $filename not found"
    exit 1
fi

while IFS= read -r line; do
    # Skip empty lines
    [[ -z "$line" ]] && continue

    echo "Processing: $line"
    # Add your processing logic here
done < "$filename"
```

This approach prevents common errors and provides clear feedback when files are missing or inaccessible.

## Reading Files with Field Separation

When your file contains structured data with delimiters, you can split lines into fields automatically:

```bash
while IFS=',' read -r name email department; do
    echo "Name: $name"
    echo "Email: $email"
    echo "Department: $department"
    echo "---"
done < employees.csv
```

The IFS (Internal Field Separator) set to comma automatically splits each line into variables based on the delimiter. This approach works well with CSV files or any delimited data format.

## Processing Large Files Efficiently

For large files, you might want to add progress indicators or process files in chunks:

```bash
total_lines=$(wc -l < large_file.txt)
current_line=0

while IFS= read -r line; do
    ((current_line++))

    # Show progress every 1000 lines
    if ((current_line % 1000 == 0)); then
        printf "Progress: %d/%d lines processed\r" "$current_line" "$total_lines"
    fi

    # Process the line
    echo "$line" | grep "pattern" >> filtered_output.txt

done < large_file.txt

echo -e "\nProcessing complete!"
```

This provides visual feedback during long-running operations and helps you monitor script progress.

## Handling Files with Different Encodings

When processing files that might contain special characters or different encodings, ensure your script handles them correctly:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
    # Process the line, handling the last line even if it doesn't end with newline
    echo "Line: $line"
done < <(iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 input.txt)
```

The `|| [[ -n "$line" ]]` condition ensures the last line gets processed even if it doesn't end with a newline character. The `iconv` command handles character encoding conversion.

## Reading Files into Arrays

Sometimes you need to store all lines in memory for random access or multiple processing passes:

```bash
readarray -t lines < input.txt

echo "Total lines: ${#lines[@]}"

for i in "${!lines[@]}"; do
    echo "Line $((i+1)): ${lines[i]}"
done
```

The `readarray` command loads the entire file into an array, allowing you to access lines by index or process them multiple times without re-reading the file.

## Processing Command Output Line by Line

You can apply the same techniques to process command output instead of files:

```bash
ps aux | while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ "$line" == *"nginx"* ]]; then
        echo "Found nginx process: $line"
    fi
done
```

This example processes the output of the `ps` command to find specific processes. The pipe creates a subshell, so variables modified inside the loop won't persist outside it.

## Using Process Substitution to Avoid Subshells

To maintain variable scope when processing command output, use process substitution:

```bash
count=0

while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ "$line" == *"error"* ]]; then
        ((count++))
    fi
done < <(grep -i "error" /var/log/messages)

echo "Found $count error lines"
```

The `< <(...)` syntax creates a process substitution that avoids the subshell problem, allowing the `count` variable to retain its value after the loop.

## Reading Files with Custom Record Separators

Sometimes files use delimiters other than newlines to separate records:

```bash
while IFS= read -d ';' -r record; do
    # Process each record separated by semicolons
    echo "Record: $record"
done < data.txt
```

The `-d ';'` option changes the delimiter from newline to semicolon, allowing you to process files with custom record separators.

## Parallel Processing for Performance

For CPU-intensive processing of large files, consider parallel execution:

```bash
process_chunk() {
    local chunk_file="$1"
    while IFS= read -r line; do
        # Intensive processing here
        echo "Processed: $line" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
    done < "$chunk_file"
}

# Split file into chunks and process in parallel
split -l 1000 large_file.txt chunk_
for chunk in chunk_*; do
    process_chunk "$chunk" &
done
wait  # Wait for all background processes to complete

# Clean up chunk files
rm chunk_*
```

This approach splits large files into smaller chunks and processes them simultaneously, significantly reducing processing time for CPU-bound operations.

## Error Recovery and Logging

For production scripts, implement comprehensive error handling and logging:

```bash
log_file="processing.log"

process_line() {
    local line="$1"
    local line_number="$2"

    # Simulate processing that might fail
    if [[ "$line" == *"invalid"* ]]; then
        echo "Error processing line $line_number: $line" >> "$log_file"
        return 1
    fi

    echo "Successfully processed line $line_number" >> "$log_file"
    return 0
}

line_number=0
error_count=0

while IFS= read -r line; do
    ((line_number++))

    if ! process_line "$line" "$line_number"; then
        ((error_count++))
    fi
done < input.txt

echo "Processing complete. Errors: $error_count. Check $log_file for details."
```

This framework provides detailed logging and error tracking, making it easier to debug issues and monitor script performance.

## Reading Configuration Files

A practical example of processing configuration files with key-value pairs:

```bash
declare -A config

while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
    # Skip comments and empty lines
    [[ "$key" =~ ^[[:space:]]*# ]] && continue
    [[ -z "$key" ]] && continue

    # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    key=$(echo "$key" | xargs)
    value=$(echo "$value" | xargs)

    config["$key"]="$value"
done < config.ini

# Use the configuration
echo "Database host: ${config[database_host]}"
echo "Port: ${config[port]}"
```

This example demonstrates parsing configuration files while handling comments, whitespace, and storing values in an associative array for easy access.

## Next Steps

You can now process file content efficiently using various Bash techniques. Consider exploring more advanced topics like stream processing with `awk` or `sed`, handling binary files, or implementing sophisticated parsing for complex file formats like JSON or XML using specialized tools.

Good luck with your file processing scripts!
