When working with Kubernetes, you often need to see exactly which containers are running inside a pod. This is especially useful for troubleshooting, scripting, or just getting a quick overview of your workloads.

In this guide, you'll learn several clean and efficient ways to list all containers in a Kubernetes pod using `kubectl` and related tools.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` installed and configured

## Listing Containers with kubectl

The simplest way to see containers in a pod is to describe the pod:

```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

Look for the `Containers:` section in the output. This works well for quick checks, but isn't ideal for automation or scripting.

## Using JSONPath for Clean Output

For a more script-friendly approach, use `kubectl get` with a JSONPath query to extract just the container names:

```bash
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}'
```

This command prints a space-separated list of all container names in the pod. If your pod has init containers, you can list those as well:

```bash
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.initContainers[*].name}'
```

## Listing Containers for All Pods in a Namespace

To see all containers in every pod in a namespace, you can use a loop:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -o json | jq -r '.items[] | "Pod: \(.metadata.name)\nContainers: \(.spec.containers[].name)"'
```

This uses `jq` to format the output for each pod. Replace `<namespace>` with your target namespace.

## Why This Matters

Listing containers cleanly is useful for:

- Debugging multi-container pods
- Automating health checks or log collection
- Auditing workloads in your cluster

## Next Steps

Try combining these commands with other `kubectl` queries or shell scripts to automate your Kubernetes workflows.

As you get more comfortable, explore how to extract other pod details using JSONPath and `jq` for even more powerful cluster introspection.
