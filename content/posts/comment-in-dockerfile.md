## TLDR

To add comments in a Dockerfile, use the `#` symbol. Comments are ignored during the build process and are useful for documenting your Dockerfile.

Comments in Dockerfiles are essential for documenting your code, explaining instructions, and improving readability. This guide will show you how to use comments effectively in Dockerfiles.

## Use the `#` Symbol

In Dockerfiles, comments start with the `#` symbol. Anything following the `#` on the same line is ignored by Docker during the build process.

### Example

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:18

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files into the container
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Explanation

- `# Use the official Node.js image as the base image`: Documents the purpose of the `FROM` instruction.
- `# Set the working directory inside the container`: Explains the `WORKDIR` instruction.
- `# Copy application files into the container`: Describes the `COPY` instruction.
- `# Install dependencies`: Notes the purpose of the `RUN` instruction.
- `# Start the application`: Clarifies the `CMD` instruction.

## Best Practices

- **Be Concise**: Write short and clear comments.
- **Explain Complex Instructions**: Use comments to explain non-obvious instructions.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not comment on instructions that are self-explanatory.
- **Keep Comments Updated**: Ensure comments reflect the current state of the Dockerfile.

By following these practices, you can make your Dockerfiles more readable and maintainable.
