## TLDR

The error `docker: "build" requires 1 argument. See 'docker build --help'` means you forgot to specify the build context (usually a directory) when running `docker build`. Always provide a path (like `.`) as the last argument.

## Why Does This Error Happen?

When you run `docker build`, Docker expects a build context—a directory containing your `Dockerfile` and any files needed for the build. If you don't provide this argument, Docker doesn't know what to build.

**Example of the error:**

```bash
docker build
# Output:
# docker: "build" requires 1 argument. See 'docker build --help'.
```

## How to Fix It

Add the build context (usually `.` for the current directory) at the end of your command:

```bash
docker build .
```

Or, if your `Dockerfile` is in a different directory:

```bash
docker build /path/to/context
```

You can also tag your image at the same time:

```bash
docker build -t my-image .
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting the `.` or path at the end of the command.
- Using `docker build -t my-image` without the context (should be `docker build -t my-image .`).
- Running the command from the wrong directory (make sure your `Dockerfile` is in the context directory).

## Best Practices

- Always double-check your build context before running `docker build`.
- Use `docker build -t <name> .` for most local builds.
- For CI/CD, use absolute paths or ensure the working directory is correct.

## Conclusion

The `docker: "build" requires 1 argument` error is a simple fix—just add the build context (like `.`) to your command. This ensures Docker knows where to find your `Dockerfile` and build resources.
