## TLDR

If you see `denied: requested access to the resource is denied` when pushing a Docker image, check your authentication, repository name, and permissions. Log in with `docker login` and make sure your image is tagged for the correct registry.

Pushing Docker images to a registry is a key part of most CI/CD workflows. Sometimes, you hit a frustrating error: `denied: requested access to the resource is denied`. This usually means there's a problem with authentication, repository naming, or permissions.

### Why Does This Error Happen?

- **Not Logged In**: You haven't authenticated with the registry.
- **Wrong Repository Name**: The image isn't tagged for the right registry or namespace.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: Your user doesn't have push access.

### Step 1: Check Your Image Tag

Your image must be tagged with the full registry path. For Docker Hub, this usually means `username/repo:tag`.

```bash
# Tag your image for Docker Hub
docker tag my-app:latest username/my-app:latest
```

For private registries, include the registry URL:

```bash
docker tag my-app:latest registry.example.com/my-app:latest
```

### Step 2: Log In to the Registry

Authenticate with the registry using:

```bash
docker login
```

You'll be prompted for your username and password (or token).

### Step 3: Push the Image

Now push the image:

```bash
docker push username/my-app:latest
```

If you still get the error, double-check your permissions on the registry. For Docker Hub, make sure the repository exists and your user has write access.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Double-check the image tag and registry path.
- Make sure you're logged in to the correct registry.
- Check your user permissions on the registry.
- For private registries, verify SSL certificates and network access.

By following these steps, you can resolve most Docker push errors and keep your CI/CD pipeline running smoothly.

Good luck with your project!
