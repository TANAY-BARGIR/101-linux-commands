## Introduction

Retrieving Pods running on specific nodes in a Kubernetes cluster can be useful for debugging and resource management. In this guide, you'll learn how to use the Kubernetes API to filter Pods by node.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure:

- You have `kubectl` installed and configured.
- You have access to the Kubernetes API.

## Using the Kubernetes API

### List Pods with Node Information

To list Pods along with their node information, use:

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

This command displays additional details, including the node where each Pod is running.

### Filter Pods by Node

To filter Pods running on a specific node, use:

```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=<node-name>
```

Replace `<node-name>` with the name of the node you want to filter by.

### Example

Suppose you want to retrieve Pods running on a node named `worker-node-1`. Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=worker-node-1
```

This lists all Pods running on `worker-node-1`.

### Using the Kubernetes API Directly

You can also use the Kubernetes API directly to query Pods by node. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
https://<api-server>/api/v1/pods?fieldSelector=spec.nodeName=<node-name>
```

Replace `<token>` with your API token, `<api-server>` with the API server URL, and `<node-name>` with the node name.

## Best Practices

- **Use Labels**: Label nodes and Pods for easier filtering.
- **Monitor Resources**: Use tools like `kubectl top` to monitor resource usage on nodes.
- **Automate Queries**: Use scripts or tools like `kubectl` plugins for frequent queries.

## Conclusion

Using the Kubernetes API to retrieve Pods on specific nodes is a powerful way to manage and debug your cluster. By following these steps, you can efficiently filter and monitor Pods.
